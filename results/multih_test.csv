Calculating the total for these years:
Total from 2014 to 2018 = $907.4 + $453.0 + $433.0 + $453.8 + $439.9 = $2,687.1 million

From 2019 onwards, the total amount reached $2,876.6 million.

To find the percentage of total debt maturity that occurred in 2018 and thereafter, we first calculate the overall total:
Overall total = $5,563.7 million

Now, we can calculate the percentage:
Debt maturity in 2018 and thereafter = $2,876.6 million
Percentage = (Debt maturity in 2018 and thereafter / Overall total) * 100

From the documents, we have the following information:

- **Projected Benefit Obligation at the beginning of the year:**
  - 2014: $12,197 million
  - 2013: $13,406 million

- **Projected Benefit Obligation at the end of the year:**
  - 2014: $15,081 million
  - 2013: $12,197 million

- **Service Cost:**
  - 2014: $221 million
  - 2013: $259 million

- **Interest Cost:**
  - 2014: $572 million
  - 2013: $537 million

- **Net Actuarial Gain/Loss:**
  - 2014: $2,641 million (gain)
  - 2013: -$1,469 million (loss)

- **Benefits Paid:**
  - 2014: -$556 million
  - 2013: -$536 million

Now, let's calculate the CHANGE IN PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION for both years:

1. **For 2013:**
   - Change = (Ending PBO - Beginning PBO) + Service Cost + Interest Cost + Net Actuarial Gain/Loss - Benefits Paid
   - Change = ($12,197 million - $13,406 million) + $259 million + $537 million - (-$1,469 million) - (-$536 million)
   - Change = (-$1,209 million) + $259 million + $537 million + $1,469 million + $536 million
   - Change = $592 million

2. **For 2014:**
   - Change = (Ending PBO - Beginning PBO) + Service Cost + Interest Cost + Net Actuarial Gain/Loss - Benefits Paid
   - Change = ($15,081 million - $12,197 million) + $221 million + $572 million + $2,641 million - (-$556 million)
   - Change = $2,884 million + $221 million + $572 million + $2,641 million + $556 million
   - Change = $6,874 million

Now we compare the changes:
- Change in 2013: $592 million
- Change in 2014: $6,874 million

Since $6,874 million (2014) is greater than $592 million (2013), the total amount of all elements in 2014 is indeed greater than that in 2013 for the CHANGE IN PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION for Con Edison.",Is the total amount of all elements in 2014 greater than that in 2013 for CHANGE IN PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION for Con Edison?

To find the projected amount for 2017 using the same increasing rate as in 2016, we can add the net inflows of $59,913 million to the fixed income assets of $749,996 million:

Projected Fixed Income in 2017 = $749,996 million + $59,913 million = $809,909 million.

1. Calculate the change in value:
   - Change = Final Value - Initial Value
   - Change = $6,427 - (-$23,158) = $6,427 + $23,158 = $29,585

In 2017, the total segment incurred amount was $1,061.6 million, which was a decrease of $2.1 million or -0.2% from the previous year (2016).

If we assume the same decreasing rate of 7.8% from 2016 to 2017, we can calculate the expected total incurred amount for 2017:

To calculate the growth rate of market appreciation from 2008 to 2009, we can use the following formula:

\[
\text{Growth Rate} = \frac{\text{Market Appreciation in 2009} - \text{Market Depreciation in 2008}}{|\text{Market Depreciation in 2008}|} \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Growth Rate} = \frac{12.8 - (-26.8)}{26.8} \times 100 = \frac{12.8 + 26.8}{26.8} \times 100 = \frac{39.6}{26.8} \times 100 \approx 147.76\%

From Document 2:
- Distribution fees in 2014: $2,213 million

Calculating the average:
Average = (Distribution fees + Other revenues) / 2
Average = ($2,213 million + $72 million) / 2

- 2013: 5.19 years

To find the growth rate, we can look at the change from 2011 to 2012 and from 2012 to 2013. However, since the question specifically asks for the growing rate in the year with the most Risk-free interest rate, we note that the Average expected option life decreased from 5.34 years in 2011 to 5.24 years in 2012, indicating a decline rather than growth.

The increase in total assets from 2014 to 2015 is:

The growth from 2004 to 2005 can be calculated as follows:

Growth Rate = (Notional Amount in 2005 - Notional Amount in 2004) / Notional Amount in 2004
Growth Rate = ($14,401,577 million - $11,597,813 million) / $11,597,813 million
Growth Rate = $2,803,764 million / $11,597,813 million
Growth Rate ≈ 0.241 (or 24.1%)

Assuming the same growth rate is applied to the notional amount in 2005 to estimate the notional amount in 2006:

Notional Amount in 2006 = Notional Amount in 2005 * (1 + Growth Rate)
Notional Amount in 2006 = $14,401,577 million * (1 + 0.241)
Notional Amount in 2006 ≈ $14,401,577 million * 1.241
Notional Amount in 2006 ≈ $17,878,992 million

- Equity securities: $15,482 million
- Non-U.S. sovereign debt: $15,813 million
- Corporate securities and other liabilities: $11,350 million

To find the sum of trading account liabilities without those smaller than 15,000, we exclude the corporate securities and other liabilities of $11,350 million.

- Equity securities: $15,482 million
- Non-U.S. sovereign debt: $15,813 million

Now, summing these amounts:

To find the growth rate from 2009 to 2010:

Growth = (Value in 2010 - Value in 2009) / Value in 2009
Growth = ($800 million - $695 million) / $695 million
Growth = $105 million / $695 million
Growth ≈ 0.1515 or 15.15%

If the amount of equity securities develops with the same growth rate of approximately 15.15% from 2009, the calculation for the expected amount in 2010 would be:

Expected Amount in 2010 = Value in 2009 * (1 + Growth Rate)
Expected Amount in 2010 = $695 million * (1 + 0.1515)
Expected Amount in 2010 ≈ $695 million * 1.1515
Expected Amount in 2010 ≈ $801.4 million

Therefore, if the amount of equity securities develops with the same growth rate in 2009, it would reach approximately $801.4 million in 2010. However, the actual reported amount for 2010 is $800 million.

To calculate the increasing rate of gross investment gains from 2007 to 2008:

1. Increase in gross investment gains = $858 million - $554 million = $304 million.
2. Increasing rate = (Increase / Previous year amount) * 100 = ($304 million / $554 million) * 100 ≈ 54.83%.

q847157e0,"To calculate the percentage increase of the number of Class A common stocks issued to participating employees in relation to non-executive directors from 2016 to 2017, we can extract the relevant figures from the documents.

From Document 2:
- In 2016, 19,858 shares were issued to participating employees.
- In 2017, 19,936 shares were issued to participating employees.

For non-executive directors:
- In 2016, 26,439 shares were issued.
- In 2017, 19,736 shares were issued.

Now, we calculate the percentage increase for participating employees:
- Increase = 19,936 - 19,858 = 78 shares
- Percentage increase = (78 / 19,858) * 100 = 0.39%

Next, we calculate the percentage decrease for non-executive directors:
- Decrease = 19,736 - 26,439 = -6,703 shares
- Percentage decrease = (-6,703 / 26,439) * 100 = -25.38%

The question asks for the percentage increase of the number issued to participating employees in relation to non-executive directors. Since the number issued to non-executive directors decreased, the increase in relation to them would still be noted as an increase of 0.39%.

Thus, the percentage increase of the number issued to participating employees in relation to non-executive directors amidst 2016 and 2017 is 0.39%.","considering the class a common stocks , what is the percentage's increase of the number issued to participating employees in relation non-executive directors amidst 2016 and 2017?"

Substituting the values:

\[

To find the 2018 average balance if it developed with the same growth rate as in 2017, we can calculate it as follows:

2017 average balance: $179,447 million
Growth rate from 2016 to 2017: 
\[

This is not directly provided in the documents. However, the average balance of interest-bearing deposits grew by $6,914 million from 2017 to 2018.
